# station-bikes-distance
A program that finds the various shortest distances between bike stations uaing Dijkstra's algorithm. Datasets of the random graph and stations are imported into the program. 

As per coursework requirements, the class files displays the required shortest distance answers, including the execution time. Developed using Java and NetBeans IDE.
